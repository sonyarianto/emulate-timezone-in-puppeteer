Emulate timezone in Puppeteer

I assume you already have NodeJS and npm installed on your machine.

Clone this code or fork (up to you)
```
git clone https://github.com/sonyarianto/emulate-timezone-in-puppeteer.git
```
and go to repository folder.

Install Puppeteer
```
npm i puppeteer
```

This example will test the `page.emulateTimezone()` API.
